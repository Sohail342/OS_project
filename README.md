## Introduction

The CPU Scheduling Simulator is an educational tool that simulates four popular CPU scheduling algorithms:
- FCFS (First Come First Serve)
- SJF (Shortest Job First)
- Priority-based scheduling
- Round Robin scheduling

## Features

- Simulate different scheduling algorithms.
- Add and remove processes dynamically.
- Visualize the execution order of processes.
- Adjust parameters such as burst time, arrival time, and priority.
- Display total completion time for each simulation.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
